# stm32f4_mcal
Hardware Abstraction Layer for STM32F4XX Series Microcontrollers

The plan is to create an hal for the stm32f4xx series with full functionality.

Next steps:
- Create abstration methods for specific peripherals
- Generalise the methods to be able to use them for all similar peripherals (i.e. all timers)
